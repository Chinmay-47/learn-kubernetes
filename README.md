## About
As a Data Scientist, I have been working with Docker to deploy ML applications for some time now. 
Having heard and read about Kubernetes as a technology to scale such containerized solutions, 
I decided to learn more about it.

This repository is to document my learnings about Kubernetes. 

A compilation of all the notes that I made while learning can be found 
[here](https://github.com/Chinmay-47/learn-kubernetes/blob/main/notes/all_notes.md) as a markdown.
